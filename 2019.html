          <p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro; font-size:1.5vw; color:#222;">
            BTS attended the 61st Grammy Awards as award presenters following their appearance at the LA Grammy Museum in 2018. They also received a nomination for Best Recording Package and even though none of these had much to do with their music, fans felt this was a sign the West was finally seeing them as serious artists. Their sixth EP, <i>Map of the Soul: Persona</i> was released in April becoming the best selling album in the US for 2019. They performed lead single “Boy With Luv” on <i>Saturday Night Live</i> as the first Korean act to do so and continued to promote on various American TV shows. <i>Map of the Soul: Persona</i> became their third album within eleven months to top the Billboard 200, a feat last achieved by The Beatles in 1995-96. Their global reach has been so enormous, they often get compared to The Beatles and so they paid homage to them in a themed episode of <i>The Late Show</i> with Stephen Colbert which you can watch below.

        <p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro; font-size:1.5vw; color:#222;">
          In April, Time named BTS in their 100 Most Influential People of 2019 list. It was obvious at this point, BTS is here to stay. Western and Eastern artists alike were eager to collaborate with them knowing anything BTS touched was basically gold on the charts. Industry friend Halsey featured on “Boy With Luv”, and Ed Sheeran and Lauv featured on “Make It Right”. BTS at long last received the mutual respect as artists they deserved. No longer were the boys being mocked for their three dollar chains and knock off clothing, but they were instead being recognized for their talent in music and performance. If their debut selves could see them now they might say “keep going, it’s a dream come true.”
