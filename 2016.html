            BTS’ special compilation album, <i>The Most beautiful Moment In Life: Young Forever</i> was released on May 2nd and would earn them their first ever Album of the Year award at the MMAs. After that, it was hit after hit with “Young Forever”, “Fire”, “Save Me” and the absolute decadence that was and will always be “Blood, Sweat & Tears”. This Moombahton banger was accompanied by a baroque style music video and was an artistic continuation of the BTS Universe. It referenced works such as <i>Demian: The Story of Emil Sinclair’s Youth</i> by Herman Hesse; <i>The Fall of the Rebel Angels</i> and the <i>Landscape with the Fall of Icarus</i> both painted by Peter Bruegel the Elder; and <i>The Lament for Icarus</i> by Herbert James Draper. Biblical motifs such as the event of The Last Supper, and a remodeled version of the <i>Pietà</i> by Michelangelo, were seen in some scenes, as well. The song itself simultaneously topped all eight South Korean music charts achieving whats known as an “all-kill” in Korea. This single was included in their second Korean studio album, <i>Wings</i> released on October 10th. It became their first album to sell one million copies and Rolling Stone named it “one of the most conceptually and sonically ambitious pop albums of 2016”. For the first time, it included solo tracks from each member exploring themes of temptation and adversity.

            This was an especially active year for BTS in terms of promoting. The band made various appearances in television shows and web series. V starred in reality web series, <i>Flower Boy Bromance</i> with his close actor friend, Minjae, and Jungkook would do the same in June with senior idol singer, Minwoo from Shinhwa. As a band, they played a game on Korea’s most famous variety show, <i>Running Man</i> for the 300th episode, and they also performed as headliners at KCON Newark and LA. In August, BTS attended the <i>Idol Star Athletics Championship (ISAC)</i>, a TV program where idols compete in hopes of winning and spreading their bands' names, but no one really enjoys being there. A year later, they’d break a bunch of rules like “no posting photos of the event before it airs” to ban themselves from ever attending again. Classic BTS.

          <td style="font-family:Source Sans Pro; font-size:1.2em; color:#222;">Each member has a solo track that's quite personal. For example, in "Awake", Jin sings about how compared to his bandmates, he lacks innate talent for performing. He's accepted he may never "fly" like them, but he'll keep trying with the help of his bandmates. J-Hope thanks his mother for all she's done for him in "MAMA", and RM raps about his desire to love himself despite his flaws in "Reflection".
