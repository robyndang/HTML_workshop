          <p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro; font-size:1.5vw; color:#222;">
            Bighit Entertainment’s CEO, Bang Si-Hyuk formed BTS in 2010. Initially, he wanted them to be a mature hip hop group but later decided BTS should be the voice of youth and it’d be easier to connect with that audience if they were more like a traditional Korean idol group. Idol groups are known to have high visual standards and fashion, elaborate dances and are known to be manufactured under a rigorous training system. BTS lived together in a small dorm provided by their company and each day they trained, ate, bickered, and hung out working towards the same dream. It’d be five years before they reached mainstream success.

        <p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro; font-size:1.5vw; color:#222;">
          BTS’ debut album released in June of 2013 named 2 Cool 4 Skool would be the first of their “school trilogy”. The accompanying single “No More Dream” peaked at 124 in Korea but quickly disappeared from the charts. With the album only selling 24,000 copies it wasn’t a hit and their next single “We are Bulletproof Pt 2.” failed to even chart. The chances of success were slim since they were competing against artists from JYP, SM and YG (nicknamed the “Big Three” back then) who dominated the SK music market. What they lacked in budget and industry connections they hoped they could make up for with striking performances and determination.
          <br><br>
          In September of 2013, BTS released the second album of their trilogy, O!RUL8,2? and single “N.O.” which expanded on the themes of dreams and happiness and also criticized the harsh South Korean education system. These were unusual topics to write about for an idol group, but they’d continue making socially conscious music throughout their careers. Regular fans of idol groups didn’t like them because they were “too ugly to be idols” and their tacky outfits born of budget constraints were not helping. Even though their music was hip hop and R&B, independent artists from these communities belittled them for replacing the heart of hip hop with idol group glamour. They also didn’t consider it real hip hop because they assumed they weren’t involved in the music making process as is the stereotype of idol groups, but they were in fact heavily involved. Despite not really fitting in anywhere, BTS managed to win some awards that year.
